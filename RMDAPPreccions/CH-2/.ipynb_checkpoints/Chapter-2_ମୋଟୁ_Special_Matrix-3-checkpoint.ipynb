Thus, in (2.4.4), $\\mathbf{y}^T (P^T AP)\\mathbf{y} = 0$ only when $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{0}$, i.e., $P^T AP$ is p.d. $\\square$\n",

    "**Proof:** \n",
    "\n",
    "**Property 1:** By Definitions 2.4.5 and 2.4.6, the matrix $A$ is p.d. (or p.s.d.) if the quadratic form $\\mathbf{x}^T A \\mathbf{x}$ is p.d.

    "**Property 2:** Since $A$ and $B$ are both n.n.d., we have by Definition 2.4.4 that for every non-null vector $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, $\\mathbf{x}^T A \\mathbf{x} \\geq 0$ and $\\mathbf{x}^T B \\mathbf{x} \\geq 0$. Hence, $\\mathbf{x}^T A \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{x}^T B \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{x}^T (A + B)\\mathbf{x} \\geq 0$, which implies that the matrix $A + B$ is n.n.d. \n",

    "In addition, suppose that $A$ is p.d.

Hence, $\\mathbf{x}^T (A + B)\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{x}^T A \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{x}^T B \\mathbf{x} > 0$, so that $A + B$ is p.d.\n",

We can write the resulting submatrix as $P^T AP$, where $P$ is the $n \\times m$ matrix of rank $m$, whose columns are the $i_1, \\ldots, i_m$-th columns of $I_n$. If $A$ is n.n.d., it follows from Result 2.4.1 that $P^T AP$ is too. In particular, the principal minors of a p.d. matrix are all positive. $\\square$\n",

    "**Proof:** Suppose that, on the contrary, the p.d. matrix $A$ is singular, with $r(A) < n$. The columns of $A$ are linearly dependent and hence there exists a vector $\\mathbf{v} \\neq \\mathbf{0}$ such that $A\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}$, which implies that $\\mathbf{v}^T A \\mathbf{v} = 0$, which is a contradiction to our assumption that $A$ is p.d. Hence $A$ must be nonsingular, and let $A^{-1}$ denote the regular inverse of $A$. \n",

    "Since $A$ is p.d., by Result 2.4.1, $(A^{-1})^T AA^{-1}$ is p.d. But $(A^{-1})^T AA^{-1} = (A^{-1})^T$, implying that $(A^{-1})^T$ is p.d. and so is $A^{-1}$. $\\square$\n",
