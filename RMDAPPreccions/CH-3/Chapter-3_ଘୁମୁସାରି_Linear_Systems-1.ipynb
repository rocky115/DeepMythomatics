    "\n",
    "**Existence:** By Result 2.2.1, the full-rank factorization of an $m \\times n$ matrix $A$ with $r(A) = r$ is given by:\n",

    "\n",
    "**Theorem:** Let $A$ be an $m \\times n$ matrix with rank $r$. By Result 1.3.14, there exists an $m \\times m$ nonsingular matrix $B$ and an $n \\times n$ nonsingular matrix $C$, such that:\n",

    "\n",
    "where $D$ is the $m \\times n$ partitioned matrix $\\text{diag}(I_r, O)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then the entire set of g-inverses of $A$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$G = C^{-1} \\begin{pmatrix} I_r & K \\\\ L & M \\end{pmatrix} B^{-1}$$\n",

    "- $K \\in \\mathbb{R}^{r \\times (m-r)}$\n",
    "- $L \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(n-r) \\times r}$ \n",
    "- $M \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(n-r) \\times (m-r)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Properties:**\n",
    "- $G$ is an affine subspace of the linear space of $n \\times m$ matrices\n",
    "- Its dimension is $mn - r^2$\n",
    "- The rank of a g-inverse of $A$ can be any one of $r, r+1, \\ldots, \\min(m,n)$\n",

    "### Proof\n",
    "\n",
    "A matrix $G$ is a g-inverse of $A$ if and only if:\n",
    "$$BDCGBDC = BDC$$\n",
    "\n",

    "Let us denote:\n",
    "$$CGB = \\begin{pmatrix} Q & K \\\\ L & M \\end{pmatrix}$$\n",

    "Consider the matrix:\n",
    "$$A = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 2 & 6 \\\\ 2 & 3 & 8 \\\\ 6 & 8 & 22 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n",

    "**Step 1:** Check the rank\n",
    "Since $|A| = 0$, we have $r(A) \\leq 2$.\n",

    "Let $B_{11} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 6 \\\\ 2 & 8 \\end{pmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then $|B_{11}| = 16 - 12 = 4 \\neq 0$, so $B_{11}$ is nonsingular and $r(A) = 2$.\n",

    "**Step 3:** Apply the algorithm from Result 3.1.2\n",
    "Using the algorithm corresponding to $B_{11}$, we find the g-inverse:\n",

    "\n",
    "The example demonstrates that even if $A$ is a symmetric matrix, its g-inverse is not necessarily symmetric. However, we can always construct a symmetric g-inverse of a symmetric matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Construction Method:** If $A^-$ is any g-inverse of a symmetric matrix $A$, then $(A^-)^T$ is also a g-inverse (see Result 3.1.5), and therefore, the symmetric matrix $\\frac{1}{2}(A^- + (A^-)^T)$ is a g-inverse of $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative Method:** We may obtain a symmetric g-inverse by applying the same permutation to both rows and columns in the algorithm of Result 3.1.2. This results in a symmetric $B_{11}$ and therefore a symmetric g-inverse.\n",
