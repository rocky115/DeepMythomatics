    "# Perfect Sampling in MCMC Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores the concept of Perfect Sampling, a significant advancement in Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology. As noted in the book excerpt:\n",
    "\n",
    "> There were enough broken slates underfoot to show that the process was imperfect.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> — Liz Tomlin, *Set in Darkness*\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous chapters have dealt with methods that are quickly becoming \"mainstream\" - analyses using Monte Carlo methods in general, and MCMC specifically. While these methods are part of the applied statistician's tool kit, they continue to evolve with new algorithms constantly being developed, some resulting in procedures that differ radically from current standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the final two chapters of the book, we'll cover methods that show promise of evolving into mainstream methods and becoming standard tools for practicing statisticians.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 13.1 Perfect Sampling: A Theoretical Foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "MCMC methods have been presented as an alternative to direct simulation methods like Accept-Reject algorithms, primarily because they can approximate or process complex distributions. The ultimate evolution in simulation methods is to devise exact or \"perfect\" sampling techniques based on these MCMC approaches.\n",

    "### What is Perfect Sampling?\n",
    "\n",
    "Perfect sampling (also known as exact sampling or perfect simulation) allows us to draw samples from the exact stationary distribution of a Markov chain without requiring a burn-in period or convergence assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference from traditional MCMC methods:\n",
    "- Traditional MCMC: Approximates the target distribution after running the chain for \"long enough\"\n",
    "- Perfect sampling: Guarantees that samples are drawn exactly from the target distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem with Traditional MCMC\n",
    "\n",
    "In traditional MCMC methods, we face several challenges:\n",

    "# Perfect Sampling: Theoretical Framework and Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Perfect Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "Perfect sampling represents a significant advancement in Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology. While novel algorithms in this area are often computationally intensive and memory-demanding, they offer substantial benefits over traditional Accept-Reject algorithms. As noted in the text:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Novel algorithms are often quite greedy in both computing time and storage space, but this is the price to pay for using a more generic construction in the Accept-Reject algorithms. Before starting this chapter, we must stress that the following methods, while general in their principles, are still to be perfected in their statistical applications, with the main bulk of perfect sampling implementations being found in spatial process problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Challenge of MCMC Convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 12 detailed the difficult task of assessing the convergence of an MCMC sampler - determining the quality of the approximation $\\pi^{(t)} \\approx \\pi(z)$ and, correspondingly, the determination of a \"long enough\" simulation time. \n",
    "\n",
    "A fundamental issue with traditional MCMC methods is that they rarely provide a crystal-clear signal that $\\pi^{(t)} \\approx \\pi(z)$ is valid for all simulation purposes. The corresponding MCMC algorithm ends up providing an exact simulation from the stationary distribution $\\pi(z)$ and thus fulfills the purpose of the previous chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Connection Between Convergence Assessment and Perfect Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "There exists an important connection between the convergence assessment (Chapter 12) and perfect sampling methods (Chapter 13). The methods developed in this chapter, even when they are too costly to be implemented to deliver perfect samples, can be used to evaluate the required simulation time or the so-called \"burn-in\" period - that is, to pre-run Γ(B) ($B$ ≫ 0) iterations to determine \"how long is long enough?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Theoretical Foundations of Perfect Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "The key theoretical advantage of perfect sampling over traditional implementation techniques is that it removes dependence on the starting value, something Metropolis-Hastings algorithms cannot achieve without running multiple algorithms in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perfect sampling represents the extreme implementation of this concept, where it produces samples from $\\pi(z)$ without the dependency of running the chains until the dependence on the starting value(s) has vanished.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Formal Definition and Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "Perfect sampling refers to algorithms that sample directly from the stationary distribution $\\pi(z)$ - that is, algorithms such as the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm that provide exact draws from specific distributions and/or truncations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"perfect simulation\" for such techniques was first introduced by Propp and Wilson (1996), with a more triumphant description being \"exact sampling.\" The work by Fill (1998), explaining how coupling techniques deal, so far, with finite state spaces, had to turn, for ease of use, to the greatest simplicity of these spaces and, for another to statistical physics applications related to the Ising model. The classic paper by Propp and Wilson and further implementations presented in much more detail, e.g., Murdoch and Green (1998) have shown that some standard examples in continuous settings, like the nuclear pump failure model of Example 10.17 (see Problem 12.24), do allow for perfect simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coupling From The Past (CFTP)\n",
    "\n",
    "The CFTP algorithm introduced by Propp and Wilson (1996) provides a framework for perfect sampling by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simulating Markov chains that start from all possible states at some time in the past\n",
    "2. Running these chains forward in time using the same random numbers\n",
    "3. If all chains coalesce to the same state by the present time, that state is a sample from the stationary distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, for a Markov chain with transition kernel $P$ and state space $\\mathcal{S}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(X_t = j | X_{t-1} = i) = P(i, j)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The CFTP algorithm constructs a sample $X_0 \\sim \\pi$ where $\\pi$ is the stationary distribution satisfying:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\pi P = \\pi$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formal CFTP Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with a time $T < 0$\n",
    "2. Initialize copies of the chain at time $T$ with all possible states $s \\in \\mathcal{S}$\n",
    "3. Generate random numbers to be used for transitions\n",
    "4. Run all chains forward from time $T$ to time $0$ using the same random numbers\n",
    "5. If all chains coalesce to the same state $x$ at time $0$, return $x$\n",
    "6. Otherwise, set $T = 2T$ and repeat\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Duality Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in settings when the Duality Principle of Section 9.2 applies, the stationarity of the finite chain obviously transfers to the dual chain, even if the latter is continuous.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Monotone CFTP\n",
    "\n",
    "For large or infinite state spaces, running chains from all possible starting states is infeasible. If the Markov chain has a monotonicity property, we can implement monotone CFTP by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Only tracking chains starting from the minimum and maximum states\n",
    "2. If these extreme chains coalesce, all chains will coalesce\n",
    "\n",
    "For a partially ordered state space $(\\mathcal{S}, \\leq)$ with minimum element $\\bot$ and maximum element $\\top$, if the update function $\\phi$ is monotone:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x \\leq y \\implies \\phi(x, U) \\leq \\phi(y, U)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we only need to track $X_t^{\\bot}$ and $X_t^{\\top}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages of Perfect Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Exactness:** Samples are drawn exactly from the target distribution\n",
    "2. **No burn-in period:** Eliminates the need to discard initial samples\n",
    "3. **No convergence diagnostics:** No need to assess whether the chain has reached stationarity\n",
    "4. **Theoretical guarantees:** Provides mathematical guarantees about the quality of samples\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations of Perfect Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Computational complexity:** Often requires more computation than traditional MCMC\n",
    "2. **State space restrictions:** Easier to implement for discrete or bounded continuous spaces\n",
    "3. **Implementation complexity:** Generally more complex to implement than traditional MCMC\n",
    "4. **Memory requirements:** Can require significant storage space\n",
    "\n",
    "## Application Domains\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spatial Point Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "Perfect sampling has been successfully applied to spatial point processes, particularly:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Area-interaction point processes\n",
    "2. Strauss processes\n",
    "3. Hard-core processes\n",
    "\n",
    "For a spatial point process with density:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x) \\propto \\beta^{n(x)} \\gamma^{s(x)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n(x)$ is the number of points and $s(x)$ is a statistic of the point pattern, perfect sampling can be implemented using dominated CFTP.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ising Models\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ising model from statistical physics, with Hamiltonian:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H(\\sigma) = -J\\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle} \\sigma_i \\sigma_j - h\\sum_i \\sigma_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "can be perfectly sampled using CFTP when $J > 0$ (ferromagnetic case) due to its monotonicity properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Continuous State Space Models\n",
    "\n",
    "For continuous state spaces, perfect sampling is more challenging but can be achieved through:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dominated CFTP:** Using bounding chains that sandwich the target chain\n",
    "2. **Multigamma coupler:** For specific multivariate distributions\n",
    "3. **Perfect slice sampler:** Based on the slice sampling technique\n",
    "\n",
    "## Determining \"How Long is Long Enough\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Perfect sampling techniques can be used to determine appropriate burn-in periods for traditional MCMC when perfect sampling itself is too computationally intensive:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run perfect sampling for a small number of samples\n",
    "2. Calculate the typical coalescence time $T_c$\n",
    "3. Use $T_c$ as the burn-in period for traditional MCMC\n",
    "\n",
    "This provides a principled way to set the burn-in period rather than relying on heuristics or convergence diagnostics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Perfect sampling represents a significant theoretical advancement in MCMC methodology, allowing us to draw samples from the exact stationary distribution without concerns about burn-in and convergence. While computationally demanding, these methods provide a gold standard for sampling and can guide the use of more efficient approximate methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated in the text, while these methods are still being perfected in their statistical applications, they show great promise for becoming standard tools for practicing statisticians, particularly as computational power increases and algorithms become more efficient.\n",

    "## Coupling from the Past\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed earlier, a major drawback of using MCMC methods for simulating a distribution $\\pi$ is that their validation is only asymptotic. Formally, we would need to run the transition kernel an infinite number of iterations to achieve simulation precisely from the stationary distribution $\\pi$. This is obviously impossible in practice, except if we can construct a stopping time $\\tau$ on the Markov chain such that the chain at that time has the same distribution as one running for an infinite number of steps,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\theta^{(\\tau)} \\sim \\pi(\\theta).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Propp and Wilson (1996) were the first to come up with such a stopping time.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Random Mappings and Coupling\n",
    "\n",
    "In a finite state-space $\\mathcal{X}$ of size $k$, the method proposed by Propp and Wilson (1996) is called **coupling from the past (CFTP)**. The principle is to start $k$ Markov chains, one in each of the $k$ possible states, far in the past at time $-T_0$ and if all these parallel chains take the same value (or **coalesce**) by a fixed time 0, say, then the starting value is obviously irrelevant. Moreover, the distribution of the chain at time 0 is the same as if we had started the iterations at time $-\\infty$, given that a chain starting at time $-\\infty$ would necessarily take one of the $k$ values at time $-T_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement this principle requires a valid technique that ensures that coalescence at time 0 can occur with a large enough probability. For instance, if we run the above $k$ chains independently, the probability that they all take the same value by time 0, will decrease as a power of $k$, whatever $T_0$. We thus need to remove the (between) independence assumption and use a coupling scheme (see Section 6.6.1), which both guarantees that all chains are marginally generated from the original transition kernel and that two chains that once take the same value remain identical forever after. A convenient representation for coupling proceeds through the notion of **random mapping**: given that a Markov chain transition can generically represented as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\theta^{(t)} = \\psi(\\theta^{(t-1)}, u_t),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the $u_t$'s are iid from a (fixed) distribution (Borovkov and Foss 1992, see Problem 13.3), we can define the successive iterations of an MCMC algorithm as a sequence of random mappings on $\\mathcal{X}$,\n",

    "where $\\Psi_t(\\theta) = \\psi(\\theta, u_t)$. In particular, we can write\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\theta^{(t)} = \\Psi_t \\circ \\ldots \\circ \\Psi_1(\\theta^{(0)}),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is also called a stochastic recursive sequence. An important feature of this sequence of random mappings is that, for a given $\\theta^{(0)}$, the successive images of $\\theta^{(0)}$ by the compositions $\\Psi_t \\circ \\ldots \\circ \\Psi_1$ are correctly distributed from the $t$ transitions of the original Markov chain. Therefore, for two different starting values, $\\theta_1^{(0)}$ and $\\theta_2^{(0)}$, the sequences\n",

This difficulty is easily overcome, though, by modifying $\\Psi$ into a function such that $u_t$ is the seed used in the pseudo-random generator at time $t$ (see Chapter 2). This eliminates the pretense of simulating, for each $t$, an infinite sequence of uniforms.\n",

    "Random mappings are central to the coupling from the past scheme of Propp and Wilson (1996): if we find a time $T < 0$ such that the composition $\\Psi_0 \\circ \\ldots \\circ \\Psi_T$ is constant, the value of the chain at time 0 is independent of the value of the chain at time $T$ and, by induction, of the value of the chain at time $-\\infty$. In other words, if we formally start a chain at time $-\\infty$, it will end up at time 0 with the same value no matter the starting value. Before establishing more rigorously the validity of Propp and Wilson's (1996) scheme, we first state a fundamental theorem of coupling.\n",

While it is the case that, for a fixed time $T^* > \\tau$, $\\theta_{T^*}^{(j)}$ is distributed from the stationary distribution, the fact that $\\tau$ is a stopping time implies that $\\theta_\\tau^{(j)}$ is usually not distributed from $\\pi$, as shown in Example 13.4 (see also Problems 13.1 and 13.2)."
