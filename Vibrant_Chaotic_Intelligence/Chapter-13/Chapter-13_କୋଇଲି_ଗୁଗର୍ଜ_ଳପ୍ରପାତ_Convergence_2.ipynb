    "## Propp and Wilson's Algorithm: Coupling from the Past\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Coalescence in Markov Chains\n",
    "\n",
    "We are examining a technique for sampling from the stationary distribution of a Markov chain, specifically using the \"Coupling from the Past\" algorithm developed by Propp and Wilson.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin by understanding the mathematical background:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Markov Chain Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Given:\n",
    "- $\\theta^{(t)} = j$\n",
    "- $\\theta_{t+1}^{(i)} = \\Phi(\\theta_t^{(i)}, u_{t+1})$, where the $u_t$'s are mutually independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **time $\\tau$ to coalescence** is a random variable that depends only on $U_1, U_2, \\ldots$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interpreting Coalescence Time\n",
    "\n",
    "An interpretation of the coalescence time $\\tau$ is that it is the time at which the initial state of the chain has \"worn off\": the distribution of $\\theta^{(t)}$ is obviously the same for all $t > \\tau$. A natural subsequent question is whether or not $\\theta^{(t)}$ is a draw from the stationary distribution $\\pi$.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is the case that, for a fixed time $T > \\tau$, $\\theta_T^{(i)}$ is distributed from the stationary distribution, the fact that $\\tau$ is a stopping time implies that $\\theta^{(\\tau)}$ is usually not distributed from $\\pi$, as illustrated in Example 13.4 (see also Problems 13.1 and 13.2).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Propp and Wilson's Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of the above principle thus reduces to a search for a constant composition $\\Phi_0 \\circ \\ldots \\circ \\Phi_T$: once such $T < 0$ is found, coalescence occurs between time $T$ and time 0, and the common value of the chains at time 0 is distributed from $\\pi$. The algorithm, called **coupling from the past**, is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm A.54 - Coupling from the Past\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate random mappings $\\Phi_0, \\Phi_{-1}, ...$\n",
    "2. Define compositions ($k = 1, 2, ...$):\n",
    "   $$\\Phi_T^{(k)}(\\theta) = \\Phi_0 \\circ \\Phi_{-1} \\circ ... \\circ \\Phi_{T}(\\theta)$$\n",
    "3. Determine $T$ such that $\\Phi_T^{(k)}$ is constant by looking successively at $T = -1, -2, -4, -8, ...$\n",
    "4. For an arbitrary value $\\theta_0$, take $\\Phi_T^{(k)}(\\theta_0)$ as a realization from $\\pi$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Step 3 of this algorithm, the backward excursion \"stops\" at one time $T$ when $\\Phi_T^{(0)}$ is a constant function, so we are thus spared the task of running the algorithm until $-\\infty$! The same applies to the simulation of the random mappings $\\Phi_t$, which only need to be simulated till time $T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, by virtue of the separate definitions of the maps $\\Phi_t$, for a given $\\theta_T$, the value of $\\theta^{(0)}$ is also preset. This ensures the correct distribution time but, more importantly, it ensures the validity of the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theorem 13.5\n",
    "The algorithm [A.54] produces a random variable distributed exactly according to the stationary distribution of the Markov chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: To establish that $\\Phi_T^k$ is constant is formally equivalent to consider all possible starting states at time $T$ and to run the corresponding coupled chains till time 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement this algorithm in practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Verify with traditional calculation of stationary distribution\n",
    "# For this chain, π = [0.6667, 0.3333]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Theoretical Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "The key advantages of Propp and Wilson's algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It provides an **exact** sample from the stationary distribution, not an approximation\n",
    "2. It automatically determines the appropriate \"burn-in\" period without user intervention\n",
    "3. It eliminates the need to assess convergence through diagnostics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its elegant theoretical properties, the algorithm has some practical limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It can be computationally expensive for large state spaces\n",
    "2. It requires the ability to simulate all possible chain trajectories simultaneously \n",
    "3. The coalescence time can be prohibitively long for some Markov chains\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "Several extensions to the basic algorithm exist:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Monotone CFTP**: For partially ordered state spaces with monotone transition functions\n",
    "2. **Read-once CFTP**: A modification that doesn't require storing past random seeds\n",
    "3. **Perfect Slice Sampler**: An adaptation for continuous state spaces\n",

    "Propp and Wilson (1996) suggested monitoring the maps only at times $-1, -2, -4, \\ldots$, until coalescence occurs (at time 0), as this updating scheme has nearly optimal properties. Note that omitting some times when checking for a constant $\\phi_T$ does not invalidate the method. It simply means that we may go further backward than necessary.\n",

    "##  Monotonicity and Envelopes\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, the primary drawback of perfect sampling in realistic statistical problems is not obvious, given that the principle applies only to a finite state space with a manageable number of points. However, an important remark in Propp and Wilson (1996) (which has been exploited in many subsequent papers) is that the spectrum of perfect sampling can be extended to settings where a *monotonicity structure* is available, namely, when there exists a (stochastic) ordering $\\leq$ on the state space such that the extremal states for this ordering are known a priori. Moreover, ordering is preserved by the updates from the random function $\\phi_t$, namely, that if $\\theta_a \\leq \\theta_b$, $\\phi_t(\\theta_a) \\leq \\phi_t(\\theta_b)$ for all $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The existence of monotonicity structures immensely simplifies the implementation of the CFTP algorithm and correspondingly allows for extension to much more complex problems. For instance, if there exists a (stochastically) *larger* state denoted 1 and a (stochastically) *smaller* state 0, the CFTP can be run with only two chains starting from 1 and 0: when these two chains coincide at time 0, $\\phi_{-t,0}(0) = \\phi_{-t,0}(1) = \\phi_{-t,0}(\\theta)$, i.e., the (virtual) chains starting from all possible states at time $-t$ have coalesced. Therefore, we do not require monitoring and this turns out to be a big gain if $\\mathcal{X}$ is large.\n",

    "## Python Implementation of the Extended Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's implement the extended example to see how coalescence is achieved:\n",

    "\n",
    "When a monotonicity structure is available, we can greatly simplify the algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Analysis of Monotonicity\n",
    "\n",
    "The monotonicity property can be expressed mathematically as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\forall \\theta_a, \\theta_b \\in \\mathcal{X}, \\theta_a \\leq \\theta_b \\implies \\phi_t(\\theta_a) \\leq \\phi_t(\\theta_b)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This property ensures that if we track only the minimum and maximum states, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\phi_{-t,0}(0) = \\phi_{-t,0}(1) \\implies \\phi_{-t,0}(\\theta) = \\phi_{-t,0}(0) = \\phi_{-t,0}(1) \\; \\forall \\theta \\in \\mathcal{X}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The computational advantage is substantial: instead of tracking $|\\mathcal{X}|$ chains, we only need to track 2 chains.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Applications of Monotonicity\n",
    "\n",
    "Monotonicity has been particularly useful in:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ising models** in statistical physics\n",
    "2. **Spatial point processes** in spatial statistics\n",
    "3. **Queueing networks** where states represent queue lengths\n",
    "4. **Bayesian hierarchical models** with certain prior structures\n",
    "\n",
    "In each case, the existence of natural orderings on the state space combined with transition functions that preserve these orderings allows the CFTP algorithm to be applied efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The example demonstrates how coalescence occurs in the Coupling from the Past algorithm and how monotonicity can be leveraged to make the method practical for large state spaces. The key insights are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Coalescence may require going further back in time than initially anticipated\n",
    "2. When a monotonicity structure exists, we only need to track two chains: one starting from the minimum state and one from the maximum state\n",
    "3. The algorithm produces exact samples from the stationary distribution without requiring burn-in or convergence diagnostics\n",

It is thus sufficient to monitor the chains started from 0 and from $n$ to check for coalescence, for any value of $n$. This property can be observed in Figure 13.1.\n",

    "## Example 13.6. Mixtures of distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the simplest possible mixture structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f_p(x) = pf_0(x) + (1-p)f_1(x),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where both $f_0$ and $f_1$ are known, with a uniform prior on $0 < p < 1$. For a given sample $x_1, \\ldots, x_m$, the corresponding Gibbs sampler is based on the following steps at iteration $t$:\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "$$m^{(t)} = \\sum_{i=1}^m z_i^{(t)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Simulate $p^{(t)} \\sim \\text{Beta}(1 + m^{(t)}, 1 + m - m^{(t)})$\n",
    "\n",
    "To design a coupling strategy and a corresponding CFTP algorithm, we first notice that $m^{(t)}$ can only take $n+1$ possible values, namely, $0, 1, \\ldots, n$. We are thus de facto in a finite setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we recall that a $\\text{Beta}(1 + n, 1 + m - n)$ random variable can be represented as the ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Analysis of Monotonicity in Example 13.5\n",
    "\n",
    "The monotonicity property demonstrated in Example 13.5 is crucial for efficient implementation of the CFTP algorithm. Let's analyze this property more carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the beta-binomial model with transition kernel $K(x_i, x_{i+1})$, the monotone ratio property means that for any $x_1 > x_2$ and states $y_1 > y_2$, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{K(x_1, y_1)}{K(x_2, y_1)} \\geq \\frac{K(x_1, y_2)}{K(x_2, y_2)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This property, known as the monotone likelihood ratio property, implies stochastic monotonicity: if $x_1 \\geq x_2$, then for any increasing function $h$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_y K(x_1, y)h(y) \\geq \\sum_y K(x_2, y)h(y)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of coupling from the past, this means:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If we start two chains from states $0$ and $n$ respectively\n",
    "2. Apply the same random mappings to both chains\n",
    "3. The chain starting from state $n$ will always be in a state greater than or equal to the chain starting from state $0$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, once these extremal chains meet, all other chains must have coalesced as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mixture Models and CFTP\n",
    "\n",
    "For the mixture model in Example 13.6, the finite state space formed by the possible values of $m^{(t)}$ allows us to apply CFTP directly. The key insights are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The state space has $n+1$ possible values: $\\{0, 1, \\ldots, n\\}$\n",
    "2. For each possible state, we need to determine the transition probabilities\n",
    "3. The transitions depend on the random variables $u_i^{(t)}$\n",
    "4. We can construct a monotone coupling by using the same $u_i^{(t)}$ values for all chains\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constructing the Coupling\n",
    "\n",
    "For the mixture model, the coupling construction works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For time points $t = -T, -T+1, \\ldots, -1$, generate the random variables $u_i^{(t)}$ for $i = 1, \\ldots, m$\n",
    "2. For each possible state $m^{(t)} \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, n\\}$, compute the next state using the same $u_i^{(t)}$ values\n",
    "3. Check if all possible starting states at time $-T$ lead to the same state at time $0$\n",
    "\n",
    "The transition function can be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Phi(m^{(t)}, u^{(t)}) = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\mathbf{1}\\left[u_i^{(t)} \\leq \\frac{p(m^{(t)})f_0(x_i)}{p(m^{(t)})f_0(x_i) + (1-p(m^{(t)}))f_1(x_i)}\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p(m^{(t)})$ is drawn from $\\text{Beta}(1 + m^{(t)}, 1 + m - m^{(t)})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monotonicity in the Mixture Model\n",
    "\n",
    "To establish monotonicity in the mixture model, we need to show that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$m_1 \\geq m_2 \\implies \\Phi(m_1, u) \\geq \\Phi(m_2, u)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This holds if the probability ratio in step 2 is increasing in $m$. Since $p(m)$ is stochastically increasing in $m$ (as the Beta distribution parameter increases), and the ratio $\\frac{pf_0(x_i)}{pf_0(x_i) + (1-p)f_1(x_i)}$ is increasing in $p$, we have the necessary monotonicity property.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Theoretical Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "The examples demonstrate two important theoretical implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reduced computational complexity**: When monotonicity exists, we only need to track two chains instead of all possible states.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Extension to countable state spaces**: For countable state spaces with monotonicity properties, CFTP can still be applied by tracking only the extremal states.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Connection to Perfect Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples highlight the power of monotonicity in perfect sampling. When a Markov chain exhibits monotonicity:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We can verify coalescence by checking only the extremal states\n",
    "2. The computational cost becomes independent of the size of the state space\n",
    "3. We obtain exact samples from the stationary distribution without approximation error\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach has been particularly useful in statistical applications involving high-dimensional distributions where traditional MCMC methods may struggle to assess convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples 13.5 and 13.6 demonstrate how monotonicity properties can be leveraged to implement efficient perfect sampling algorithms. By exploiting the structure of the transition kernels, we can reduce the computational burden of checking coalescence and extend the applicability of CFTP to more complex models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The monotone ratio property in Example 13.5 and the finite state space representation in Example 13.6 are representative of the mathematical structures that enable perfect sampling in practice."

    "For all $w_1,...,w_{m+2}$ iid $\\mathcal{L}ep(1)$, we notice in addition that, if we use for all parallel chains a common vector $(w_1^{(t)},...,w_{m+2}^{(t)})$ of iid $\\mathcal{L}ep(1)$ random variables, $w_1^{(t)}$ is uncorrelated with $w_1^{(t')}$. We have therefore exhibited a monotone structure associated with the Gibbs transition kernel and we thus only need to monitor two chains: one started with $m^{(1-T)} = 0$ and the other with $m^{(2-T)} = n$, and check whether or not they coalesce by time $t = 0$. Figure 13.2 (left) illustrates this sandwiching argument sketched above: if we start from all possible chains, that is, from all possible values of $m^{(t)}$, they have all coalesced by the time the two \"extreme\" chains have coalesced. Figure 13.2 (right) provides an additional (if unnecessary) checking that the stationary distribution is indeed the distribution of the chain at time $t = 0$.\n",

    "As stressed by Kendall (1998) and Kendall and Møller (1999, 2000), this monotonicity can actually be weakened into an *envelope or sandwiching argument*: if one can find two sequences $(\\underline{\\theta}_t)$ and $(\\overline{\\theta}_t)$, generated from a transition not necessarily associated with the target distribution $\\pi$, such that, for any starting value $\\theta_0$,\n",
