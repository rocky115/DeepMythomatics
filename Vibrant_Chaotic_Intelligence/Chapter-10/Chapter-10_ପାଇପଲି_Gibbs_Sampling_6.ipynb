    "## A Bit of Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Although somewhat removed from statistical inference in the classical sense and based on direct techniques used in statistical Physics, the landmark paper by Geman and Geman (1984) proved to be compelling and has inspired significant application. This paper is also responsible for the name Gibbs sampling, because it introduced this method for the Bayesian study of Gibbs random fields which, in turn, derive their name from the physicist Josiah Willard Gibbs (1839-1903). The original implementation of the Gibbs sampler was applied to a discrete image processing problem and did not involve continuous.\n",
    "\n",
    "The work of Geman and Geman (1984) built on that of Metropolis et al. (1953) and Hastings (1970), but the statistical Bayesian community seems to have ignored (or been unaware of) a paper that sparked the interest in Bayesian methods, statistical computing, algorithms, and stochastic processes through the use of computing algorithms such as the Gibbs sampler or the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. It is interesting to see, in retrospect, that while papers had proposed similar solutions but did not find the same response from the statistical community. Among these, one may quote those by Hammersley and Clifford (1968), Ripley (unpublished) et al. (1984), Kiefer and Wolfowitz (1956), and Tanner and Wong (1987).\n",
    "\n",
    "##  The BUGS Software\n",
    "\n",
    "The acronym BUGS stands for *Bayesian inference using Gibbs sampling*. This software was developed by Spiegelhalter et al. (1995, 1996) at the MRC Biostatistics Unit in Cambridge, England. As shown by its name, it has been designed to take advantage of the possibilities of the Gibbs sampler in Bayesian analysis. BUGS includes a language which is close to standard mathematical notation for probability models, and the type specifications for simplicity include levels of the prior modeling. For instance, for the benchmark nuclear pump failures dataset of Example 10.17, the model and priors are defined by\n",
    "``` python \n",
    "\n",
    "for (i in 1:N) {\n",
    "theta[i] ~ dgamma(alpha, beta)\n",
    "lambda[i] ~ dgamma(alpha + x[i], beta + t[i])\n",
    "x[i] ~ dpois(lambda[i]*t[i])\n",
    "}\n",
    "alpha ~ dexp(1.0)\n",
    "beta ~ dgamma(0.1,1.0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "(see Spiegelhalter et al. 1996b, p.9). Most standard distributions are recognized by BUGS (as listed in Spiegelhalter et al. 1996a), which also allows for a large range of transforms. BUGS also recognizes most standard functions like exp, sqrt, sin, cos, and atan. The output of BUGS is a table of the simulated values of the parameters after an open number of warming iterations, the layers also being able to vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "A major restriction of this software is the use of the conjugate priors or, at least, log-concave distributions for the Gibbs sampler to apply. However, more complex distributions can be handled by discretization of their support and assessment of the sensitivity to the discretization step. In addition, improper priors are not accepted and must be replaced by proper priors with usual variances, like dexp(1,0.0001) with exponential or normal N(0,10000) priors, mean 0 and precision (inverse variance) 0.0001.\n",
    "\n",
    "The BUGS manual (Spiegelhalter et al. 1996a) is quite informative and well written. In addition, the authors have compiled a most helpful example manual (Spiegelhalter et al. 1996,1996c), which exhibits the ability of BUGS to deal with an amazing number of models, including meta-analysis, latent variable, survival analysis, GLM, image analysis, Bayesian design, spatial models, reliability theory, and a few. (Some of these models are presented in Problems 10.29-10.36.) The BUGS software is also compatible with the convergence diagnosis software CODA detailed in Note 10.6.2.\n",

    "\n",
    "Consider $X_1,\\ldots,X_n$ distributed from a mixture of geometric distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "IT IT: the notation, that is, Spring 2004, the BUGS software is available as WinBUGS (for Windows) and on the Web http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/bugs for a wide variety of platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider $X_1,\\ldots,X_n \\sim \\int_\\theta \\theta^x (1-\\theta) dG(\\theta), \\quad X_i \\in \\mathbb{N},$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $G$ is an arbitrary distribution on $[0,1]$. In this nonparametric setup, the likelihood can be expressed in terms of the moments\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mu_i = \\int_0^1 \\theta^i dG(\\theta), \\quad i = 1, \\ldots,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "since $G$ is then identified by the $\\mu_i$'s. The likelihood can be written\n",

    "$$L(\\mu_1, \\mu_2, \\ldots; x_1, \\ldots, x_n) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (\\mu_{x_i} - \\mu_{x_i+1}).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A direct maximization of this likelihood as a function of the moments would be between the moments, such as $\\mu_i \\ge \\mu_{i+1}^{i/(i+1)}$ which create dependencies between the different moments (Problem 10.38). The generalized moments technique (see Olset 1974 and Dette and Studden 1997, can overcome this difficulty by expressing the constraints of a sequence $\\{\\mu_i\\}$ on [0,1] (see Problem 10.38). Since the $\\mu_i$'s are not constrained, they can be encoded as uniform on [0,1]. The connection between the $\\mu_i$'s and the $\\zeta_i$'s is given by recursive relations. Let $\\zeta_0 = 1 - \\mu_1, \\zeta_1 = \\mu_1$, and $\\zeta_i = \\mu_i \\zeta_{i-1}, (i \\ge 2)$, and define\n",
    "\n",
    "$$S_{1,k} = \\zeta_1 + \\ldots + \\zeta_k, \\quad (k \\ge 1)$$\n",
    "$$S_{j,k} = \\sum_{i=j}^k \\zeta_i S_{j-1,i-j+1}, \\quad (j \\ge 2).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is then possible to prove that $\\mu_i = S_{i,i} / S_{i-1,i-1}$ (see Problem 10.38).\n",
    "\n",
    "From a computational point of view, the definition of the $\\mu_i$'s via recursion equations complicates the exact derivation of Bayes estimators, and they become too costly when max $x_i > 5$. This setting where numerical complexity prevents the practical derivation of Bayes estimators can be solved via Gibbs sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The complexity of the relations $S_{j,k}$ is due to the action of the sums in the recursive equations for instance\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mu_3 - \\mu_4 = \\zeta_1 \\zeta_2 \\zeta_3 \\{p_1 \\zeta_0(p_1 \\zeta_2 + p_2 \\zeta_1) + p_2 \\zeta_0(p_1 \\zeta_3 + p_2 \\zeta_2 + p_3 \\zeta_1)\\}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The complexity can be drastically reduced through a (counterintuitive or completion) device, every sum $S_{j,k}$ in the recursion equation is replaced by one of its terms $\\zeta_j^* S_{j-1, k-j+1}^*$ iff $j \\le k$. In fact, $\\mu_k - \\mu_{k+1}$ is then a product of $p_i$'s and $q_j$'s, which leads to a beta distribution on the parameters $p_j$. To achieve such simplification, note that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(X_i = k) = \\mu_k - \\mu_{k+1} = \\zeta_1 S_{k-1, k}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "can be interpreted as a marginal distribution of the $X_i$ by introducing $Z_1^i \\in \\{0,1\\}$ such that\n",

    "$$P(X_i = k, Z_1^i = 1) = \\zeta_1 \\zeta_2 S_{k-2, k}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, in a similar manner, introduce $Z_2^i \\in \\{0,1,2\\}$ such that the density of $(X_i, Z_1^i, Z_2^i)$ (with respect to counting measure) is $$f(x_i, z_1^i, z_2^i) = \\zeta_{z_1^i+1} \\zeta_{z_1^i+z_2^i+1} S_{z_2^i-z_1^i, x_i-z_2^i}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The replacement of the $S_{j,k}$'s thus requires the introduction of $(k-1)$ variables $Z_j^i$ for each observation $X_i$. Once the model is completed by the $Z_j^i$'s, the posterior distribution of $p_j$,\n",

    "\n",
    "is a product of beta distributions on the $p_j$'s, which can easily simulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the distribution of $Z_j^i$ conditionally on $p_j$ and the other dummy variables $Z_l^i$ ($l \\neq j$) is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\pi(z_j^i|p,z_{-j}^i = v, z_{j-1}^i = w) \\propto p_{w,w+1} 1_{z_j^i=w+1} + \\cdots + p_{v-1,v} 1_{z_j^i=v-1}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gibbs sampler thus involves a large number of (additional) steps in this case, namely $1 + \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - 1)$ simulations, since it imposes the \"local\" generation of the $Z_j^i$. In fact, an arbitrary grouping of $k$'s would make the simulation much more difficult, except for the case of a division of $\\mathbb{N}$ as $\\{0\\}, \\{1\\}, \\ldots$ into subvectors (corresponding to the old and new indices, respectively).\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that the parameter of interest is $\\Psi = \\{p_1,\\ldots,p_{K-1}\\}$, where $K$ is the largest observation. (The distribution of $\\Psi$ for indices larger than $F-1$ is unmodified by the observations. See Robert 2001.) Although $\\Psi$ is generated conditionally on the complete data $(x_j, Z_j^i : (i = 1, \\ldots, n)$, this form of Gibbs sampling is not a Data Augmentation scheme since the $Z$'s are not simulated conditionally on $\\Psi$ but rather one component at a time, with distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(z_j^i|p,z_{-j}^i = v, z_{j-1}^i = w) \\propto p_{w,w+1} 1_{z_j^i=w+1} + \\cdots + p_{v-1,v} 1_{z_j^i=v-1}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the complexity does not prevent the application of Theorem 2.13 since the sequence of interest is generated conditionally on the $X_i$'s. Geometric convergence thus applies."

    "# Graphical Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphical models use graphs to analyze statistical models. They have been developed mainly to represent conditional independence relations, primarily in the field of expert systems (Whittaker 1990, Spiegelhalter et al. 1993). The Bayesian approach to these models, as a way to incorporate model uncertainty, has been aided by the advent of MCMC techniques, as stressed by Madigan and York (1995) in an expository paper on which this note is based.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Construction of a Graphical Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The construction of a graphical model is based on a collection of independence assumptions represented by a graph. We briefly recall here the essentials of graph theory and refer to Lauritzen (1996) for details. A graph is defined by a set of vertices or nodes, $v \\in V$, which represents the random variables or factors under study, and a set of edges, $(a, b) \\in E^{2}$, which can be ordered (the graph is then said to be directed) or not (the graph is undirected). For a directed graph, $a$ is a parent of $b$ if $(a, b) \\in E^{2}$. Graphs are also often assumed to be acyclic, meaning there are no cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Directed graphs can be turned into undirected graphs by adding edges between nodes which share a child and dropping the directions.\n",
    "# Directed Acyclic Graphs and Probabilistic Models\n",
    "\n",
    "The notion of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), introduced by Kiiveri and Speed (1982), often leads to the construction of probabilistic models on graphs, an important concept in the field of expert systems and statistical modeling. A DAG is a directed graph with no cycles, ensuring there is a maximal subset of nodes which are all independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Construction of Probabilistic Models on Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a graph where there is no subset containing $C$ and satisfying this condition. An ordering of the cliques of an undirected graph $(C_1, \\dots, C_k)$ is perfect if the nodes of each clique $C_i$ are contained in a previous clique or are members of one of the previous cliques (these nodes are called the separators, $\\sigma \\in S$). In this case, the joint probability distribution of the random variable $V$ taking values in $V$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(V) = \\prod_{v \\in V} p(v \\mid \\pi(v)),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\pi(v)$ denotes the parents of $v$. This can also be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(V) = \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^n p(C_i)}{\\prod_{i=1}^{n-1} p(S_i)},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the model is then called decomposable (see Spiegelhalter and Lauritzen 1990, and David and Lauritzen 1993 or Lauritzen 1996). As stressed by Spiegelhalter et al. (1993), the representation (10.19) leads to a principle of local computation, which extends the building of a prior distribution, or the simulation from a conditional distribution, to a single clique. (In other words, the distribution is Markov with respect to the undirected graph, as shown by David and Lauritzen 1993.) The appeal of this property for Gibbs' implementation is then obvious.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the densities or probabilities are parameterized, the parameters are denoted by $\\theta$, for the marginal distribution of $V \\in A, A \\subset V$. (In the case of discrete models, $\\theta_v$ may coincide with $p$ itself; see Example 10.33.) The prior distribution $\\pi(\\theta)$ must then be compatible with the graph structure. David and Lauritzen (1989) show that a solution is of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\pi(\\theta) = \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^n \\pi(\\theta_{C_i} \\mid \\sigma_i)}{\\prod_{i=1}^{n-1} \\pi(\\theta_{S_i} \\mid \\sigma_i)},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "thus reproducing the clique decomposition (10.19).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 33: Discrete Event Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a decomposable graph such that the random variables corresponding to all the nodes of $V$ are discrete. Let $w \\in W$ be a possible value for the vector of these random variables and $\\theta(w)$ be the associated probability. For the perfect clique decomposition $(C_1, \\dots, C_n)$, $\\theta(w)$ denotes the marginal probability that the clique vector $(v_1, v \\in C_1), \\dots, (v_n, v \\in C_n)$ takes the value $w$, and, similarly, $\\theta_{S_i}(w')$ is the probability that the subvector $(v, v \\in S_i)$ takes the value $w'$ when $(S_1, \\dots, S_n)$ is the associated sequence of separators. In this case:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\theta(w) = \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^n \\theta_{C_i}(w_i)}{\\prod_{i=1}^{n-1} \\theta_{S_i}(w'_i)}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As illustrated by Madigan and York (1995), a Dirichlet prior can be constructed on $w$, $(w_i, w \\in W)$, which leads to the conclusion that the Dirichlet weights are identical over the intersection of two cliques. David and Lauritzen (1993) demonstrate that this prior is unique, given the marginal priors on the cliques."
