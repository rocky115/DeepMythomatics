    "## Some Background on Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We shall be concerned with the modeling and analysis of random experiments using the theory of probability. The outcome of such an experiment is the result of a **stochastic** or **random process**. In particular, we shall be interested in the way in which the results or outcomes vary or evolve over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **experiment** or **trial** is any situation where an outcome is observed. In many of the applications considered, these outcomes will be numerical—sometimes in the form of counts or enumerations. The experiment is **random** if the outcome is not predictable or is uncertain.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first, we are going to be concerned with simple mechanisms for creating random outcomes, namely **games of chance**. One recurring theme initially will be the study of the classical problem known as **gambler’s ruin**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will then move on to applications of probability to modeling in, for example, engineering, medicine, and biology.\n",
    "\n",
    "We make the assumption that the reader is familiar with the basic theory of probability. This background will, however, be reinforced by the brief review of these concepts which will form the main part of this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "In random experiments, the list of all possible outcomes is termed the **sample space**, denoted by \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This list consists of individual outcomes or elements. Sample spaces can have a **finite** or **infinite** number of outcomes, and can be **discrete** or **continuous**.\n",
    "\n",
    "These elements have the properties that they are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mutually exclusive**: two or more outcomes cannot occur simultaneously.\n",
    "- **Exhaustive**: all possible outcomes are in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, each time the experiment is carried out, one of the outcomes in $ S $ must occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **collection of elements of** $ S $ is called an **event**. These are usually denoted by capital letters: $ A, B, $ etc. We denote by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(A)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "the **probability** that the event $ A $ will occur at each repetition of the random experiment. Remember that $ A $ is said to have occurred if one element making up $ A $ has occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to calculate or estimate the probability of an event $ A $, there are two possibilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Empirical approach**: Perform the experiment a large number of times, and approximate $ P(A) $ by the **relative frequency** with which $ A $ occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Theoretical approach**: Use principles and assumptions to compute $ P(A) $ analytically.\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze random experiments, we make the assumption that the **conditions surrounding the trials remain the same**, and that the trials are **independent** of one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "We hope that some regularity or \"settling down\" of the outcomes occurs with repeated trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Probability Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of probability deals with measuring the likelihood of events occurring. When we perform an experiment repeatedly, the ratio of the number of times a particular event $A$ occurs to the total number of trials is known as the **relative frequency** of the event. As the number of trials increases, this relative frequency appears to converge to a value known as the **probability** of outcome $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Equally Likely Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "For a finite sample space $S$, if we can assume that the outcomes of an experiment are equally likely to occur (as with rolling a fair die or flipping an unbiased coin), the probability of an event $A$ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A) = \\frac{\\text{number of elements of }S\\text{ where }A\\text{ occurs}}{\\text{number of elements in }S}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Subjective Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all experiments are repeatable. For instance, horse races are only run once, so the probability of a particular horse winning cannot be calculated by relative frequency. However, a punter may form an estimate based on other repeatable factors:\n",
    "- Past form of the horse\n",
    "- Form of other horses in the race\n",
    "- State of the course\n",
    "- Record of the jockey\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to a view of probability as a \"degree of belief\" about uncertain outcomes. Bookmakers' odds reflect how punters place their bets and are set to ensure the bookmakers make a profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Set Theory in Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "It's convenient to use set notation when working with probabilities:\n",
    "- The sample space $S$ is termed the universal set (the set of all possible outcomes)\n",
    "- An event $A$ is a subset of $S$\n",
    "- More complex events can be constructed using unions and intersections of several events\n",
    "\n",
    "## Set Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Venn diagrams help visualize the main set operations used in probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Union\n",
    "The union of two sets $A$ and $B$ is the set of all elements belonging to $A$, or to $B$, or to both:\n",
    "$$A \\cup B = \\{x|x \\in A \\text{ or } x \\in B \\text{ or both}\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intersection\n",
    "The intersection of two sets $A$ and $B$ contains all elements common to both sets:\n",
    "$$A \\cap B = \\{x|x \\in A \\text{ and } x \\in B\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complement\n",
    "The complement of a set $A$ contains all elements in the universal set $S$ that are not in $A$:\n",
    "$$A^c = \\{x | x \\notin A\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "In an experiment involving two events $A$ and $B$, the expression $A^c \\cap B$ represents \"only $B$\" - the intersection of the complement of $A$ and $B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visual Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to draw Venn diagrams for these operations:\n",
    "- $A \\cup B$ would show the total area covered by both circles\n",
    "- $A \\cap B$ would show only the overlapping region of the circles\n",
    "- $A^c$ would show the entire universal set except for circle $A$\n",
    "- $A^c \\cap B$ would show the part of circle $B$ that doesn't overlap with circle $A$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Probability Axioms\n",
    "\n",
    "These set operations help us define the fundamental axioms of probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For any event $A$, $P(A) \\geq 0$\n",
    "2. $P(S) = 1$, where $S$ is the sample space\n",
    "3. If $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive events (i.e., $A \\cap B = \\emptyset$), then $P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$\n",
    "\n",
    "From these axioms, we can derive other important probability rules:\n",
    "- $P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)$\n",
    "- For any events $A$ and $B$: $P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B)$"

    "# Probability Concepts Extended\n",
    "\n",
    "## Set Operations - Visual Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1.1 illustrates key set operations using Venn diagrams:\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) **Union**: The union $A \\cup B$ represents all elements in either $A$ or $B$ or both  \n",
    "(b) **Intersection**: The intersection $A \\cap B$ represents elements common to both $A$ and $B$  \n",
    "(c) **Complement**: The complement $A^c$ represents all elements in the universal set $S$ that are not in $A$  \n",
    "(d) **Set Difference**: $A^c \\cap B$ or $B \\setminus A$ represents elements in $B$ but not in $A$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Set Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Set Difference**: $B \\setminus A$ means \"B but not A\" (elements in $B$ that are not in $A$)\n",
    "- **Empty Set**: We denote by $\\phi$ the empty set, which contains no elements\n",
    "- **Universal Set Complement**: Note that $S^c = \\phi$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mutually Exclusive Events\n",
    "\n",
    "Two events $A$ and $B$ are said to be **mutually exclusive** if they have no events in common, so that $A \\cap B = \\phi$ (the empty set). In set terminology, $A$ and $B$ are said to be disjoint sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Probability Axioms\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of any event satisfies the three axioms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Axiom 1**: $0 \\leq P(A) \\leq 1$ for every event $A$\n",
    "- **Axiom 2**: $P(S) = 1$\n",
    "- **Axiom 3**: $P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$ if $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive ($A \\cap B = \\phi$)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extension to Multiple Events\n",
    "\n",
    "Axiom 3 may be extended to more than two mutually exclusive events, say $k$ of them represented by $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_k$ in $S$ where $A_i \\cap A_j = \\phi$ for all $i \\neq j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Partition of a Sample Space\n",
    "\n",
    "A collection of events $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_k$ is called a **partition** of $S$ if:\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) $A_i \\cap A_j = \\phi$ for all $i \\neq j$ (events are mutually exclusive)\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) $A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup \\ldots \\cup A_k = S$ (events are exhaustive - one of them must occur)\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) $P(A_i) > 0$ (there is a nonzero probability that any $A_i$ occurs)\n",
    "\n",
    "From these conditions, it follows that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$1 = P(S) = P(A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup \\cdots \\cup A_k) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} P(A_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Theorems\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Fig.1 (a) The union A ∪ B of A and B; (b) the intersection A ∩ B of A and B; (c) the complement Ac of A: S is the universal set; (d) Ac ∩ B or B\\A.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(a) Complement Rule**: $P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)$\n",
    "\n",
    "This follows from:\n",
    "- $A \\cup A^c = S$ (an event either occurs or doesn't occur)\n",
    "- $A \\cap A^c = \\phi$ (an event cannot both occur and not occur)\n",
    "- $P(S) = 1$ (Axiom 2)\n",
    "- $P(A \\cup A^c) = P(A) + P(A^c)$ (since $A$ and $A^c$ are mutually exclusive)\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore: $1 = P(S) = P(A \\cup A^c) = P(A) + P(A^c)$, which gives us $P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)$"
