    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we analyze the case of right censoring for the lifetimes of light bulbs. Each light bulb has a lifetime that is conditionally exponential with mean $ m = \\frac{1}{c} $, where $ c $ follows a standard exponential distribution. We observe $ n = 5 $ light bulbs over a time period of 6 units, with the recorded lifetimes:\n",

    "Here, the asterisk $(*$) denotes right-censored values that exceed 6.\n",

    "### Posterior Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the posterior distribution of $ c $, we start with the probability of censoring for the observed data. The probability that a lifetime $ y_i $ is greater than 6, given $ c $, is:\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(y_i | c) = c e^{-cy_i}\n",
    "$$\n",
