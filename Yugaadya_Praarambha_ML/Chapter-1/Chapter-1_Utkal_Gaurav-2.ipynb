    "## 2.3 Solving Systems of Linear Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "In (2.3), we introduced the general form of a system of linear equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a_{11}x_1 + \\cdots + a_{1n}x_n = b_1$$\n",
    "$$\\vdots$$\n",
    "$$a_{m1}x_1 + \\cdots + a_{mn}x_n = b_m \\quad (2.37)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $a_{ij} \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $b_i \\in \\mathbb{R}$ are known constants, and $x_j$ are unknowns, for $i = 1, \\ldots, m$ and $j = 1, \\ldots, n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen that matrices can be used to compactly represent systems of linear equations as $Ax = b$, as shown in (2.10). We also defined basic matrix operations like addition and multiplication. In this section, we will focus on solving systems of linear equations and provide an algorithm for finding the inverse of a matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3.1 Particular and General Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Before discussing general methods for solving linear systems, let's look at an example. Consider the system:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 8 & -4 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 2 & 12 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\\\ x_4 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 42 \\\\ 8 \\end{bmatrix} \\quad (2.38)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This system has two equations and four unknowns, so we expect infinitely many solutions. This system is in a simplified form, where the first two columns consist of a 1 and a 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to find scalars $x_1, \\ldots, x_4$ such that $\\sum_{i=1}^4 x_i c_i = b$, where $c_i$ is the $i^{th}$ column of the matrix and $b$ is the right-hand side of (2.38).\n",
    "\n",
    "A solution can be found by taking 42 times the first column and 8 times the second column:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$b = \\begin{bmatrix} 42 \\\\ 8 \\end{bmatrix} = 42 \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} + 8 \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\quad (2.39)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, a solution is $[42, 8, 0, 0]^\\top$. This is called a **particular solution** or **special solution**.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this is not the only solution. To capture all other solutions, we need to generate 0 in a non-trivial way using the columns of the matrix. Adding 0 to our special solution does not change it. To do this, we express the third column using the first two columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{bmatrix} 8 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix} = 8 \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} + 2 \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\quad (2.40)$$"
