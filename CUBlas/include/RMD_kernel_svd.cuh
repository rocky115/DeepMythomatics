/*Creating a header file kernel_svd.cuh involves defining the CUDA kernel functions used for Singular Value Decomposition
 * (SVD). Typically, in a CUDA project, you might want to implement some of the matrix operations required for SVD in
 * custom kernels if the standard cuBLAS functions are not enough for your needs.
 * Hereâ€™s an example of what the kernel_svd.cuh header file might look like. This file declares the CUDA kernels and
 * related utility functions for performing matrix operations relevant to SVD.

/*
 * Explanation
Header Guards: Prevent multiple inclusions of the header file.

Kernel Declarations:

svd_decomposition_kernel: A placeholder kernel function for performing SVD operations.
matrix_multiply_kernel: A kernel function for matrix multiplication, which is often used in SVD computations.
Function Declarations:

perform_svd: A utility function that will manage the SVD operation by invoking CUDA kernels and handling memory transfers.
