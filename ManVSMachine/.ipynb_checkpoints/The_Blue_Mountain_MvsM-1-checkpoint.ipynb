This feedback between the learning system and the interaction experience is useful to improve performance in the task being learned. The machine learning based on data feedback is called reinforcement learning. Q-learning is a popular model-free reinforcement learning and learns a reward or punishment function (action-value functions, simply called Q-function).\n",

The information at different hierarchy levels obtained in the learning process is very helpful to the interpretation of data such as text, image, and voice. Deep learning is a complex machine learning algorithm, which has achieved much better results in speech and image recognition than previous related technologies.\n",
