    "## 2.4 Calculus\n",
    "\n",
    "For a long time, how to calculate the area of a circle remained a mystery. Then, the ancient Greek mathematician Archimedes came up with the clever idea to inscribe a series of polygons with increasing numbers of vertices on the inside of a circle (Fig. 2.4.1). For a polygon with \\( n \\) vertices, we obtain \\( n \\) triangles. The height of each triangle approaches the radius \\( r \\) as we partition the circle more finely. At the same time, its base approaches \\( \\frac{2\\pi r}{n} \\), since the ratio between arc and secant approaches 1 for a large number of vertices. Thus, the area of the polygon approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ n \\cdot r \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi r}{n}\\right) = \\pi r^2. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This limiting procedure leads to both differential calculus and integral calculus. The former can tell us how to increase or decrease a function value by manipulating its arguments. This comes in handy for the optimization problems that we face in deep learning, where we repeatedly update our parameters in order to decrease the loss function. Optimization addresses how to fit our models to training data, and calculus is its key prerequisite. However, do not forget that our ultimate goal is to perform well on previously unseen data. That problem is called generalization and will be a key focus of other chapters.\n",

    "### 2.4.1 Derivatives and Differentiation\n",
    "\n",
    "Put simply, a derivative is the rate of change in a function with respect to changes in its arguments. Derivatives can tell us how rapidly a loss function would increase or decrease were we to increase or decrease each parameter by an infinitesimally small amount. Formally, for functions \\( f : \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R} \\), that map from scalars to scalars, the derivative of \\( f \\) at a point \\( x \\) is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This term on the right-hand side is called a limit and it tells us what happens to the value of an expression as a specified variable approaches a particular value. This limit tells us what the ratio between a perturbation \\( h \\) and the change in the function value \\( f(x+h) - f(x) \\) converges to as we shrink its size to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "When \\( f'(x) \\) exists, \\( f \\) is said to be differentiable at \\( x \\); and when \\( f'(x) \\) exists for all \\( x \\) on a set, e.g., the interval \\([a, b]\\), we say that \\( f \\) is differentiable on this set. Not all functions are differentiable, including many that we wish to optimize, such as accuracy and the area under the receiving operating characteristic (AUC). However, because computing the derivative of the loss is a crucial step in nearly all algorithms for training deep neural networks, we often optimize a differentiable surrogate instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can interpret the derivative \\( f'(x) \\) as the instantaneous rate of change of \\( f(x) \\) with respect to \\( x \\). Letâ€™s develop some intuition with an example. Define:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def f(x):\n",
    "    return 3 * x ** 2 - 4 * x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting \\( x = 1 \\), \\( h \\) approaches 2 as \\( h \\) approaches 0. While this experiment lacks the rigor of a mathematical proof, we will soon see that indeed \\( f'(1) = 2 \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for h in 10.0**np.arange(-1, -6, -1):\n",
    "    print(f'h={h:.5f}, numerical limit={(f(1+h)-f(1))/h:.5f}')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "h=0.10000, numerical limit=2.30000\n",
    "h=0.01000, numerical limit=2.03000\n",

    "h=0.00001, numerical limit=2.00003\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several equivalent notational conventions for derivatives. Given \\( y = f(x) \\), the following expressions are equivalent:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f'(x) = y' = \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{df}{dx} = Df(x) = D_x f(x), $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the symbols \\( \\frac{d}{dx} \\) and \\( D \\) are differentiation operators. Below, we present the derivatives of some common functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{d}{dx} C = 0 \\quad \\text{for any constant } C $$\n",
    "$$ \\frac{d}{dx} x^n = nx^{n-1} \\quad \\text{for } n \\neq 0 $$\n",
    "$$ \\frac{d}{dx} e^x = e^x $$\n",
    "$$ \\frac{d}{dx} \\ln x = x^{-1} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions composed from differentiable functions are often themselves differentiable. The following rules come in handy for working with compositions of any differentiable functions \\( f \\) and \\( g \\), and constant \\( C \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Differentiation Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Constant multiple rule:**\n",
    "   $$ \\frac{d}{dx} [C f(x)] = C \\frac{d}{dx} f(x) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sum rule:**\n",
    "   $$ \\frac{d}{dx} [ f(x) + g(x)] = \\frac{d}{dx} f(x) + \\frac{d}{dx} g(x) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Product rule:**\n",
    "   $$ \\frac{d}{dx} [ f(x) g(x) ] = f(x) \\frac{d}{dx} g(x) + g(x) \\frac{d}{dx} f(x) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Quotient rule:**\n",
    "   $$ \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \\right) = \\frac{ f'(x) g(x) - f(x) g'(x) }{ g^2(x) } $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this, we can apply the rules to find the derivative of \\( 3x^2 - 4x \\):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{d}{dx} [3x^2 - 4x] = 3 \\frac{d}{dx} x^2 - 4 \\frac{d}{dx} x = 6x - 4. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Plugging in \\( x = 1 \\) shows that, indeed, the derivative is 2 at this location. Note that derivatives tell us the slope of a function at a particular location.\n",

    "Thus far, we have been differentiating functions of just one variable. In deep learning, we also need to work with functions of many variables. We briefly introduce notions of the derivative that apply to such multivariate functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $ y = f (x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n) $ be a function with $ n $ variables. The partial derivative of 4 y $ with respect to its $ i $-th parameter $ x_i $ is:\n",

    "\n",
    "While we have just scratched the surface of a deep topic, a number of concepts come into focus:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Automatic differentiation**: The composition rules for differentiation can be applied mechanically, enabling automatic gradient computation.\n",
    "2. **Gradient computation**: Computing the derivatives of vector-valued functions requires matrix multiplications, forming the foundation of deep learning optimization.\n",
    "3. **Backpropagation**: Gradients allow us to determine how to adjust model parameters to minimize loss. We traverse computation graphs in a forward direction to evaluate functions and in a backward direction to compute gradients. Later chapters will introduce **backpropagation**, a key algorithm for training deep neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "From an optimization perspective, **gradients guide parameter updates** to improve model performance on unseen data. Each step of training in deep learning relies on gradient calculations to adjust weights efficiently.\n",

    "## 5 Automatic Differentiation\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from Section 2.4 that calculating derivatives is the crucial step in all of the optimization algorithms that we will use to train deep networks. While the calculations are straightforward, working them out by hand can be tedious and error-prone, and this problem only grows as our models become more complex. Fortunately, all modern deep learning frameworks take this work off of our plates by offering **automatic differentiation** (often shortened to **autograd**).\n",
    "\n",
    "As we pass data through each successive function, the framework builds a **computational graph** that tracks how each value depends on others. To calculate derivatives, automatic differentiation works backwards through this graph applying the **chain rule**. The computational algorithm for applying the chain rule in this fashion is called **backpropagation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "While autograd libraries have become a hot concern over the past decade, they have a long history. In fact, the earliest references to autograd date back over half of a century (Wengert, 1964). The core ideas behind modern backpropagation date to a PhD thesis from 1980 (Speelpenning, 1980) and were further developed in the late 1980s (Griewank, 1989). While backpropagation has become the default method for computing gradients, it is not the only option. For instance, the Julia programming language employs **forward propagation** (Revels et al., 2016).\n",
