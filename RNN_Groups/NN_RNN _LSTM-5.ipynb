    "The LSTM cell has several gates and memory units to control the flow of information. Let's denote:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\( x_t \\) as the input vector at time step \\( t \\),\n",
    "- \\( h_{t-1} \\) as the previous hidden state (output) at time step \\( t-1 \\),\n",
    "- \\( c_{t-1} \\) as the previous cell state at time step \\( t-1 \\),\n",
    "- \\( h_t \\) as the current hidden state (output) at time step \\( t \\),\n",
    "- \\( c_t \\) as the current cell state at time step \\( t \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "The LSTM cell consists of the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Forget Gate:\n",
    "   - The forget gate decides what information to discard from the cell state.\n",
    "   - It takes \\( x_t \\) and \\( h_{t-1} \\) as inputs and produces a forget gate activation vector \\( f_t \\) using a sigmoid activation function.\n",
    "   - Mathematically, the forget gate is defined as:\n",
    "     \\[ f_t = \\sigma(W_f \\cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f) \\]\n",
    "     where \\( W_f \\) is the weight matrix and \\( b_f \\) is the bias vector for the forget gate.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Input Gate:\n",
    "   - The input gate decides what new information to store in the cell state.\n",
    "   - It takes \\( x_t \\) and \\( h_{t-1} \\) as inputs and produces an input gate activation vector \\( i_t \\) and a candidate cell state update vector \\( \\tilde{c}_t \\) using sigmoid and tanh activation functions, respectively.\n",
    "   - Mathematically, the input gate and candidate cell state update are defined as:\n",
    "     \\[ i_t = \\sigma(W_i \\cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i) \\]\n",
    "     \\[ \\tilde{c}_t = \\tanh(W_c \\cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_c) \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Update Cell State:\n",
    "   - The update cell state computes the new cell state by combining the previous cell state \\( c_{t-1} \\) with the information selected by the forget gate and the information to be added by the input gate.\n",
    "   - Mathematically, the new cell state \\( c_t \\) is computed as:\n",
    "     \\[ c_t = f_t \\cdot c_{t-1} + i_t \\cdot \\tilde{c}_t \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Output Gate:\n",
    "   - The output gate decides what information to output from the cell state.\n",
    "   - It takes \\( x_t \\) and \\( h_{t-1} \\) as inputs and produces an output gate activation vector \\( o_t \\) and the next hidden state \\( h_t \\) using sigmoid and tanh activation functions, respectively.\n",
    "   - Mathematically, the output gate and the next hidden state are defined as:\n",
    "     \\[ o_t = \\sigma(W_o \\cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o) \\]\n",
    "     \\[ h_t = o_t \\cdot \\tanh(c_t) \\]\n"
