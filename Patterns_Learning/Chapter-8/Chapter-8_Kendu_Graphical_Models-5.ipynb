    "## Loopy Belief Propagation and Learning the Graph Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loopy Belief Propagation\n",
    "For many practical problems, exact inference is infeasible, and approximation methods become necessary. Two major categories of approximation methods are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Variational methods**: Deterministic approaches discussed in detail in Chapter 10.\n",
    "2. **Sampling methods**: Stochastic Monte Carlo methods, explored in Chapter 11.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we explore *loopy belief propagation*, a simple approach to approximate inference in graphs with loops. This builds on exact inference in tree-structured graphs using the **sum-product algorithm**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Idea\n",
    "The **loopy belief propagation algorithm** applies the sum-product algorithm to graphs with loops, despite no guarantee of correctness. This is possible because the message-passing rules are purely local. However, due to loops, information can circulate multiple times around the graph. \n",
    "\n",
    "- For some models, the algorithm converges.\n",
    "- For others, it does not converge.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Message Passing Schedule\n",
    "A message passing schedule determines how and when messages are passed in the algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initialization**:  \n",
    "  Begin with an initial message, defined as the unit function, across every link in both directions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Schedules**:  \n",
    "  - **Flooding schedule**: Messages are passed simultaneously across every link in both directions at each time step.\n",
    "  - **Serial schedules**: Messages are passed one at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pending Messages\n",
    "Following Kschischnang et al. (2001), a message is considered **pending** if:\n",
    "- Node $a$ has received a new message on any of its links since the last time it sent a message to $b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a node receives a new message, it creates pending messages on all other links.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Convergence and Marginals\n",
    "- For **tree-structured graphs**, the algorithm terminates once every message has been passed across each link in both directions, and the marginal probabilities are exact.\n",
    "- For **graphs with loops**, termination is not guaranteed, but the algorithm often converges in practice within a reasonable time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the algorithm has converged or stopped, approximate local marginals are computed using the product of the most recently received incoming messages at each node.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Effectiveness\n",
    "The algorithm's performance varies:\n",
    "- In some cases, it provides poor results.\n",
    "- In other cases, it is highly effective, e.g., for decoding error-correcting codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning the Graph Structure\n",
    "In addition to inference, there is interest in learning the structure of the graph from data (Friedman and Koller, 2003).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bayesian Approach\n",
    "From a Bayesian perspective, the posterior distribution over graph structures is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(m|D) \\propto p(m)p(D|m)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $m$: Graph structure.\n",
    "- $D$: Observed data set.\n",
    "- $p(m)$: Prior over graphs.\n",
    "- $p(D|m)$: Model evidence, which serves as the score for each graph structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges\n",
    "1. **Marginalization**: Computing $p(D|m)$ involves marginalizing over latent variables, which is computationally challenging.\n",
    "2. **Structure Space**: The number of possible graph structures grows exponentially with the number of nodes, necessitating heuristic approaches for practical exploration.\n"
