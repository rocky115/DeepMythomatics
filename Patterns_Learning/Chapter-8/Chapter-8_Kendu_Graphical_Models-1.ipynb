    "\n",
    "Probabilities play a central role in modern pattern recognition. We have seen in Chapter 1 that probability theory can be expressed in terms of two simple equations corresponding to the sum rule and the product rule. All of the probabilistic inference and learning manipulations discussed in this book, no matter how complex, amount to repeated application of these two equations. We could therefore proceed to formulate and solve complicated probabilistic models purely by algebraic manipulation. However, we shall find it highly advantageous to augment the analysis using diagrammatic representations of probability distributions, called **probabilistic graphical models**. These offer several useful properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. They provide a simple way to visualize the structure of a probabilistic model and can be used to design and motivate new models.\n",
    "2. Insights into the properties of the model, including conditional independence properties, can be obtained by inspection of the graph.\n",
    "3. Complex computations, required to perform inference and learning in sophisticated models, can be expressed in terms of graphical manipulations, in which underlying mathematical expressions are carried along implicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph comprises **nodes** (also called **vertices**) connected by **links** (also known as **edges** or **arcs**). In a probabilistic graphical model, each node represents a random variable (or group of random variables), and the links express probabilistic relationships between these variables. The graph then captures the way in which the joint distribution over all of the random variables can be decomposed into a product of factors each depending only on a subset of the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "We shall begin by discussing **Bayesian networks**, also known as directed graphical models, in which the links of the graphs have a particular directionality indicated by arrows. The other major class of graphical models are **Markov random fields**, also known as **undirected graphical models**, in which the links do not carry arrows and have no directional significance. Directed graphs are useful for expressing causal relationships between random variables, whereas undirected graphs are better suited to expressing soft constraints between random variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of solving inference problems, it is often convenient to convert both directed and undirected graphs into a different representation called a **factor graph**. In this chapter, we shall focus on the key aspects of graphical models as needed for applications in pattern recognition and machine learning. More general treatments of graphical models can be found in the books by Whittaker (1990), Lauritzen (1996), Jensen (1996), Castillo et al. (1997), Jordan (1999), Cowell et al. (1999), and Jordan (2007).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bayesian Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to motivate the use of directed graphs to describe probability distributions, consider first an arbitrary joint distribution $ p(a, b, c) $ over three variables $ a $, $ b $, and $ c $. Note that at this stage, we do not need to specify anything further about these variables, such as whether they are discrete or continuous. Indeed, one of the powerful aspects of graphical models is that a specific graph can make probabilistic statements for a broad class of distributions.\n",

    "By application of the product rule of probability, we can write the joint distribution in the form:\n",

    "###  Generative Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative models describe the process by which data is generated. Ancestral sampling is a method for generating samples from a probability distribution defined by a directed acyclic graph (DAG).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Joint Distribution Factorization\n",
    "The joint distribution over $K$ variables factorizes as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_K) = \\prod_{k=1}^K p(x_k | \\text{pa}_k),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\text{pa}_k$ represents the parents of node $x_k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ancestral Sampling Algorithm\n",
    "1. **Order nodes** such that each node $n$ has a higher index than its parents.\n",
    "2. **Sample from the priors**:\n",
    "   - Start from the lowest-numbered node.\n",
    "   - Sample $x_1 \\sim p(x_1)$.\n",
    "3. **Conditioned sampling**:\n",
    "   - For each node $n$, sample $x_n \\sim p(x_n | \\text{pa}_n)$.\n",
    "4. **Generate marginal samples**:\n",
    "   - To sample from a subset, only retain the relevant node values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Object Recognition\n",
    "The generative process for an object recognition task can be represented by the graphical model:\n",
    "- **Latent variables**:\n",
    "  - Object identity (discrete variable).\n",
    "  - Position and orientation (continuous variables).\n",
    "- **Observed variables**:\n",
    "  - Image intensities (vector).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points\n",
    "- Generative models mimic the data generation process and are often used to simulate \"fantasy\" data.\n",
    "- To make a model generative, all input variables need probability distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8.1.3 Discrete Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Discrete probability distributions can be effectively represented in graphical models. These models are used to construct joint distributions from simpler building blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Probability of a Discrete Variable\n",
    "For a single discrete variable \\(x\\) with \\(K\\) states:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(x | \\mu) = \\prod_{k=1}^K \\mu_k^{x_k},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $\\mu = (\\mu_1, \\ldots, \\mu_K)$,\n",
    "- $\\sum_{k=1}^K \\mu_k = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Joint Distribution Over Two Variables\n",
    "For two discrete variables \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\), each with \\(K\\) states:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(x_1, x_2 | \\mu) = \\prod_{k=1}^K \\prod_{l=1}^K \\mu_{kl}^{x_{1k} x_{2l}},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\mu_{kl}$ represents the joint probability of $x_1$ and $x_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graphical Representation\n",
    "- **Fully Connected Graph**:\n",
    "  - All possible dependencies between variables.\n",
    "  - $K^2 - 1$ parameters required.\n",
    "- **Independent Graph**:\n",
    "  - Variables are independent.\n",
    "  - Total parameters = $2(K - 1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "Consider two discrete variables:\n",
    "1. Fully connected graph (general joint distribution):\n",
    " \n",
    " ![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n",
    " \n",
    " Fig.8 A graphical model representing the process by which images of objects are created, in which the identity of an object (a discrete variable) and the position and orientation of that object (continuous variables) have independent prior probabilities. The image (a vector of pixel intensities) has a probability distribution that is dependent on the identity of the object as well as on its position and orientation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Independent variables:\n",
    "  \n",
    "![image-2.png](attachment:image-2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Fig.9 (a) This fully-connected graph describes a general distribution over two K-state discrete variables having a total of $K^2 − 1$ parameters. (b) By dropping the link between the nodes, the number of parameters is reduced to $2(K − 1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application to Large Models\n",
    "For $M$ discrete variables, the parameter count grows as $K^M - 1$, but using graphical models reduces this complexity through conditional independence.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Generative Models\n",

    "The chain of \\( M \\) discrete nodes, each having \\( K \\) states, requires the specification of the following parameters:\n",
    "- **Marginal Distribution \\( p(x_1) \\):** Requires \\( K - 1 \\) parameters.\n",
    "- **Conditional Distributions \\( p(x_i | x_{i-1}) \\) for \\( i = 2, \\ldots, M \\):** Each requires \\( K(K - 1) \\) parameters.\n",

    "K - 1 + (M - 1)K(K - 1)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This grows quadratically with \\( K \\) but linearly with \\( M \\), making it more efficient than a fully connected graph, which requires:\n",
